Smart cities integrate multiple mobile or web solutions to build a comfortable human habitation. One of these solutions is to provide an environmentally friendly, efficient and effective garbage management system. The current garbage management system. The current garbage trucks doing rounds daily or weekly , which not only doesn’t  cover every zone of the city but is a completely inefficient use of government resources. This paper proposes a cost-effective mobile or web based system for the government to utilize available resources to efficiently manage the overwhelming amounts of garbage collected each day, while also providing a better solution for the inconvenience of garbage  disposal for the citizens. Waste Management System Project this is done by a network of smart bins which integrates cloud-based techniques to monitor and analyse data

collected to provide predictive routes generated through algorithms for garbage trucks. An  web application developed for the workforce and the citizens, which primarily provides the generated routes for the workforce and finds the nearest available smart bin for citizens.

This is a PHP Project entitled Waste Collection Management System .This system manages the records and client of a Waste collector Company. The system has 2 types of users which are the Admin and the client. The system can help a certain company to manage waste collection in smart cities.  This waste collection management system is a web-based       software that was written using PHP, MySQL Database ,HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Git Hub and some other plugins/ libraries. It stores the list of the company’s clients and records of   waste collections . This will help the waste collector .

1.  TRUCK MONITORING SYSTEM
The routes will be generated using our algorithm which follow the approach followed by CVRP algorithm.  Daily routes will be generated taking into account the real time garbage level. Capacity of vehicles and the distance between bins, etc . G map API provides an efficient way and real time  distances according to the traffic parameter for the inputs.
2. Implement the secure payment system
